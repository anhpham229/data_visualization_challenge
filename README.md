# data_visualization_challenge

This is the result of my work on Module 5 - Data Visualization Challenge

How I worked on the submission:

All working files are stored in the Starter_Code/Pymaceuticals folder, which includes:

- data folder: resource with 2 CSV data files

- pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb: the initial resource file

- pymaceuticals_submission.ipynb: my completed work for the homework

- A Readme.md file is also included
